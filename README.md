# object-Detection
This project focuses on developing an Open World Object Detection system that can detect both known and unknown objects in real-time video streams. Unlike traditional closed-set models, the system dynamically adapts to unfamiliar objects by using confidence-based thresholding, enabling robust performance in changing environments.
